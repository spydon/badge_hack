Welcome to the Flutter & Friends 2024 badge hack!

Use your imagination to hack around with the provided NFC tags,
creating novel apps and games or expanding on existing ones.

Write to them, read from them, learn from them, and more.
The sky is the limit to what you'll be able to create with
your new friends from Flutter & Friends!
